            OpenAI Is Growing Fast and Burning Through Piles of Money
          </h2>
          <p>
            OpenAI monthly revenue hit US$300 million in August, up 1,700% since
            the beginning of 2023, and the company expects about $3.7 billion in
            annual sales this year, according to financial documents reviewed by
            The New York Times.
            <br /> <br />
            OpenAI estimates that its revenue will balloon to copy1.6 billion
            next year. OpenAI revenue in August more than tripled from a year
            earlier, according to the documents, and about 350 million people —
            up from around 100 million in March of this year — used its services
            each month as of June.
