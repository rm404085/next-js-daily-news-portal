This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Interview Suggestion Pack for Software Company (MERN/React focus)

🟢 1. HR Interview Preparation
✅ Common Questions + Suggested Approach

Tell me about yourself.
👉 Keep it short (1 minute), focus on education, skills, projects.
Example:

“My name is [Your Name]. I have experience in building web applications using the MERN stack. I recently built projects like a Restaurant Management System and a Vocabulary Learning App. I enjoy solving problems with React and Node.js, and I’m eager to grow as a software developer in a professional team.”

Why do you want to work in our company?
👉 Show interest in learning + company reputation.

“I want to join BSD because I know you work on large-scale software projects. This will give me an opportunity to improve my skills, contribute to real client projects, and grow with the team.”

Strengths & Weaknesses

Strength: Fast learner, teamwork, problem-solving.

Weakness: Perfectionist / nervous in speaking English (but improving).

Where do you see yourself in 3 years?
👉 “In 3 years, I see myself as a skilled full-stack developer, leading small projects and mentoring junior developers.”

Why should we hire you?
👉 “Because I already have hands-on practice with MERN stack, I can start contributing quickly. I am also motivated to learn and adapt to new technologies.”

🔵 2. Technical Interview Preparation
✅ Core Areas to Revise

React (Frontend)

Virtual DOM, JSX

Props vs State

useState, useEffect, useContext

React Router

✅ Technical Questions You May Face

What is Virtual DOM?

Difference between == and === in JS

What is the difference between props and state?

How does useEffect work?

Explain how JWT authentication works.

How do you connect Node.js with MongoDB?

Tell me about a project you built using MERN.

🟠 3. Communication & English Practice

Don’t worry if your English is not perfect → focus on clear & simple sentences.

Practice speaking answers out loud every day.

Use this template when answering:
👉 Short intro → Concept → Example
Example:
Question: What is React?
Answer: “React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses components to make code reusable. For example, I used React in my Restaurant Management project to handle the dashboard and menu system.”

🔴 4. Practical Preparation

✅ Prepare 2–3 projects to explain (Restaurant System, Vocabulary App, Tour Management, etc.)

✅ Push projects to GitHub (interviewer may check).

✅ Be ready to screen share or explain your code (if online interview).

✅ Prepare at least 1 question to ask interviewer:

“What kind of projects will I work on if selected?”

“Does BSD provide training or mentorship for juniors?”

🟣 5. Final Day Before Interview

Revise short notes (React, JS, Node, Mongo).

Prepare your self-introduction (practice 5–6 times in front of mirror).

Sleep well & dress neat (shirt/polo, clean look).

Stay calm → Interviewer wants to know how you think, not just answers.

👉 Bonus Suggestion: Even if you don’t know an answer, say politely in English:

“I am not fully confident about that, but I am willing to learn and improve.”

This shows honesty + eagerness.

## Day 1 – React Basics (English Focus)

🎯 Topics to Cover

What is React and why do we use it?

Components (Functional vs Class – focus more on Functional)

JSX (JavaScript + XML)

Props (data passing)

State with useState

Event handling in React

📝 Practice Tasks

Counter App

Create a button → Increase

Show the number on screen using useState

Props Example

Create a Card component → pass title and description as props

Event Handling Example

Create an input field → show typed text live below the input

❓ Practice Interview Questions (English)

What is React?

What are the main differences between props and state?

How does JSX work in React?

Can you explain what a functional component is?

How do you handle events in React?

🗣️ Speaking Practice (Say out loud in English)

Introduction Example:
“I am currently practicing React fundamentals. Today I built a counter app using useState. This helps me understand how state works inside a functional component.”

Props Example:
“Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only and cannot be changed inside the child.”
